# A Simple Kanban Board

#### Developed by: [Willa Qu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-willa-qu/)

<br>
Based on a coding challenge I received and did terribly on. I decided to figure my way through things at my own pace.

### Usage

`yarn start`
<br>
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

`yarn test`
<br>
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
